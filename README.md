# Outpost_Mars
This is a Outpost based game for mars. It will show and simulate all things the will be needed to run a habitat or any other outpost like establishments on mars. The structure for this game was made by two guys named Justin and Chris. It uses python and pygame for the code and mySQL for the data bases for terrain and modules.
